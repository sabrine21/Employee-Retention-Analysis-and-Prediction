# Employee-Retention-Analysis-and-Prediction
This project aims to analyze the employee retention data of a company and build a logistic regression model to predict employee retention based on several key variables.

# Exploratory Data Analysis
Before building the predictive model, we conducted exploratory data analysis to identify which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention. 
We analyzed various features like salary, department, satisfaction level, work hours, and others to understand their correlation with employee retention.

# Impact of Employee Salaries on Retention
To understand the impact of employee salaries on retention, we plotted a bar chart that shows the average salary of employees who stayed with the company 
and employees who left. The chart revealed that employees with higher salaries are more likely to stay with the company.

# Correlation between Department and Employee Retention
To understand the correlation between department and employee retention, we plotted a bar chart that shows the percentage of employees who left the company 
in each department. The chart revealed that some departments have a higher retention rate than others.

# Logistic Regression Model
After identifying the key variables that impact employee retention, we built a logistic regression model using those variables. 
The variables that were narrowed down in step 1 included salary, department, and satisfaction level.

# Model Accuracy
We measured the accuracy of the logistic regression model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
The model achieved an accuracy of 85%, which indicates that it is a good predictor of employee retention.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this project analyzed the employee retention data of a company and identified key variables that impact employee retention. 
We also built a logistic regression model that can predict employee retention based on those variables with a high level of accuracy. 
The insights from this analysis can help the company to improve employee retention and reduce turnover.
